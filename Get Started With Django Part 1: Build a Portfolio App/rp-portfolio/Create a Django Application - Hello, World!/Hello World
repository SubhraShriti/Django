For this part of the tutorial, we’ll create an app called hello_world, which you’ll subsequently delete as its not necessary for our personal portfolio site.

To create the app, run the following command:

$ python manage.py startapp hello_world
This will create another directory called hello_world with several files:

__init__.py tells Python to treat the directory as a Python package.
admin.py contains settings for the Django admin pages.
apps.py contains settings for the application configuration.
models.py contains a series of classes that Django’s ORM converts to database tables.
tests.py contains test classes.
views.py contains functions and classes that handle what data is displayed in the HTML templates.
